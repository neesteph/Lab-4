This is the code for Lab 4 web page
The main focus is using turf functions to create a hex grid and bounding box around the data points
Much of the code focuses on the style and interactivity of the map, with most being written in Javascript 

The data is fetched from a GeoJSON points file of vehicle motor collisions with pedestrians and/or cyclists in Toronto between the years 2006 and 2021

Aside from the hex grid and bounding box, other layers include neighbourhoods polygons and injury type points
